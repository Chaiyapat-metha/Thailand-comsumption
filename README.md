## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting **Thailand's electricity consumption** using a combination of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN)**. The model learns from both historical power usage and spatial relationships between different regions, improving the accuracy of energy demand predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Temporal modeling with LSTM
- 🌐 Spatial modeling with Graph Neural Networks
- 📍 Region-wise prediction across Thailand
- 📈 Evaluation metrics for performance tracking
- 🛠️ Reproducible and modular codebase

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- **LSTM**: Captures long-term temporal dependencies in time series data.
- **ST-GNN**: Learns spatial-temporal patterns by modeling provinces as graph nodes.
